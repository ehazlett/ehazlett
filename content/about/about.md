Title: about

I've been doing system administration for over 10 years.  I am mostly in the cloud these days running and managing Linux-based systems in a range of providers from Amazon to Rackspace to my own OpenStack implementation.  I am a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/wapps/training/certification/verify.html?certNumber=805010760349865&amp;verify=Verify" target="_rh">RedHat Certified Engineer</a> with experience in many different distributions including RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux.

I have also been doing application development for over 6+ years, of which 3 are in a professional setting.  I would be classified as "DevOps", having not only a strong operational support background but strong development experience as well.  I have worked in many programming languages (utilizing the best tool for the job) but Python is my strong suit.  I have a strong passion for Open Source and try to contribute to as much as possible.
